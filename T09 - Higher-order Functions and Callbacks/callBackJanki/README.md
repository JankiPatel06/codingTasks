# Practical Task 2: Understanding setInterval() and clearInterval()

## Description
This practical task involves developing a comprehensive understanding of both the `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()` functions in JavaScript. These functions are crucial for implementing repetitive tasks and controlling the execution flow in web applications.

### Key Learning Points:
- **setInterval()**: Learn how to use `setInterval()` to execute a function repeatedly at specified intervals.
- **clearInterval()**: Understand how to use `clearInterval()` to stop the repeated execution of a function.

### Why This Is Important:
- **Timer-Based Operations**: Essential for tasks such as updating the UI, polling servers, and creating animations.
- **Control Over Execution**: Gain control over the timing and stopping of repetitive operations, enhancing performance and user experience.
- **JavaScript Mastery**: Deepen your understanding of asynchronous JavaScript and event handling.
