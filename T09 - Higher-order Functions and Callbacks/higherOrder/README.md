# Practical Task 1: Custom Filter Function

## Description
In this practical task, you will be creating your own higher-order function that mimics the behavior of an existing built-in method in JavaScript. Specifically, you will develop a custom filter function, similar to the built-in `filter()` method. This exercise helps to deepen your understanding of higher-order functions, callback functions, and array manipulation in JavaScript.

### Key Learning Points:
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Understand and implement higher-order functions in JavaScript.
- **Custom Implementation**: Create a custom version of the `filter()` method.
- **Callback Functions**: Learn how to use callback functions to determine the filtering criteria.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- A modern code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- Node.js installed (optional for running the script outside the browser)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/JankiPatel06/codingTasks.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
cd higherOrder
3. **Open the project**:
Open the ‘higherOrder.js’ file in your code editor to see and edit the custom filter function. 
## Usage:
**Create the custom filter function:**:
Create a higher-order function named myFilterFunction() in a file named higherOrder.js.
The function should take two arguments:
An array of strings with 10 words, where at least three of the words have six letters.
A callback function that returns a boolean based on whether or not a word has six letters.

**Function Implementation**:

**Running the Script**:

You can run the script in a browser console or using Node.js.
To run using Node.js, navigate to the directory containing higherOrder.js and execute:
Node higherOrder.js
